# get-wakanim-subs

***If the episode is hardsubbed, it does not work!***

Get subs from wakanim.tv:

- Install the script `get-wakanim-subs.js` in your best userscript manager like [tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
- Open a Wakanim episode
- A new button should appear to get subs. If the button does not appear, refresh the page.

To modify or add new styles:
- Update the function `addHeader()`


# Bonus (for French)
With `py pyFormatWakanimASS.py`, you can format ass files:
- Add French quotation mark
- Add dialogues style with [aegisub-cli](https://github.com/Myaamori/aegisub-cli) and [baguettisation](https://github.com/someonelike-u/Baguettisation) (be sure to get my fork, not the original or it will not work)
- resync on Funimation video (less manually)

# Disclaimer
This method of use is very simple to find. I should be not really responsable of a bad use.
