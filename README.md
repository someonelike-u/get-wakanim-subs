# get-wakanim-subs

***If the episode is hardsubbed, it does not work!***

Get subs from wakanim.tv:

- Install the script `get-wakanim-subs.js` in your best userscript manager like [tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
- Open a Wakanim episode
- A new button should appear to get subs. If the button does not appear, refresh the page.

To modify or add new styles:
- Update the function `addHeader()`

# Disclaimer
This method of use is very simple to find. I should be not really responsable of a bad use.
