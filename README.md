# get-wakanim-subs
Get subs from wakanim.tv:

- Install the script `get-wakanim-subs.js` in your best userscript manager like [tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
- Open a Wakanim episode (if the episode is hardsubbed, it does not work)
- A new button should appear to get subs. If the button does not appear, refresh the page.

# Disclaimer
This method of use is very simple to find.
So, I am not responsable of a bad use.
